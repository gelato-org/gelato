VarID,Variable name,DescriptionAverage SNP count,Average SNP count,"Number of successfully typed SNP positions, averaged over the individuals within a population. This parameter is proportional to the genotyping quality."medianFST,Median FST,"Median of the FST values distribution associated to each population, against all the other populations of the dataset (global value)"medianFSTregion,Median FST within macro region,"Median of the FST values distribution associated to each population, against the other populations of the same macro geographic region"MedianFSTAdjustedNeighbors,Median FST within geographic neighbors,"Median of the FST values distribution associated to each population, against neighboring populations (minimum 2) within 1000 km radius, and excluding drifted populations"numberofNeighborswithin1000km,Number of neighbors within 1000km,Number of neighbors within a 1000km radiusharmonicMean,Ne - Effective population size,"Effective population size calculated with software IBDNe, corresponding to the harmonic mean of the last 50 generations "harmonicMean_5perc,,Lower 5% confidence interval associated to the effective population size calculationsharmonicMean_95perc,,Upper 5% confidence interval associated to the effective population size calculations
