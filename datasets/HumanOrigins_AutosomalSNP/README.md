This panel is assembled from published sources which genotyped population samples with the Human Origins SNP chip (Affymetrix).
The SNP chip is designed for studies on human population history and diversity and ascertainment bias is minimized [REFF](https://doi.org/10.1534/genetics.112.145037) 

The data consists of autosomal SNPs (597573 variants) for 3638 individuals from 342 worldwide populations with a minimum of 5 individuals per population.

The original publication from which each population genetic sample is first described is indicated.
