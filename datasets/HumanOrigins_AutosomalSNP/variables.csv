VarID,Variable name,DescriptionAverage SNP count,Average SNP count,Number of successfully typed SNP positions averaged over the individuals within a population. This parameter is proportional to the genotyping quality.medianFST,Median FST,Median of the FST values distribution associated to each population against all the other populations of the dataset (global value)medianFSTregion,Median FST within macro region,Median of the FST values distribution associated to each population against the other populations of the same macro geographic regionMedianFSTAdjustedNeighbors,Median FST within geographic neighbors,Median of the FST values distribution associated to each population against neighboring populations (minimum 2) within 1000 km radius and excluding drifted populationsnumberofNeighborswithin1000km,Number of neighbors within 1000km,Number of neighbors within a 1000km radiusharmonicMean,Ne - Effective population size,Effective population size calculated with software IBDNe corresponding to the harmonic mean of the last 50 generations harmonicMean_5perc,Ne - Effective population size 0.05 percentile,Lower 5% confidence interval associated to the effective population size calculationsharmonicMean_95perc,Ne - Effective population size 0.95 percentile,Upper 5% confidence interval associated to the effective population size calculationsFST,FST,Genetic distance between a pair of populations. Calculated with the Weir and Cockerham formula as implemented in PLINK software. Script available at https://github.com/epifaniarango/Fst_forLargeDatasetsFstLinear,Linearized FST,Linearized FST formula as FST/(1-FST)GEOdist,Geographic distance,Geographic distance between population pairs in km. Calculated from population coordinates with rdist.earth package fields in R (https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/fields/versions/13.3/topics/rdist.earth)case,Double or single pair combination,"Each population pair combination is present twice - as Pop1&Pop2 or as Pop2&Pop1 (like in a full distance matrix). Select ""single"" for using only the lower diagonal of the distance matrix."GeneticSplitTime,Genetic divergence time,Approximate divergence time calculated from Ne with the formula 2Ne x  linearized FST GeneticSplitTime_5,Genetic divergence time 0.05 percentile,Lower 5% confidence interval associated to the genetic divergence timeGeneticSplitTime_95,Genetic divergence time 0.95 percentile,Upper 5% confidence interval associated to the genetic divergence time
